# ALIFY UI QA — Home and Inner Pages

Date: 2026-11-06
Status: design, UI, accessibility, and internal information-architecture gaps closed.
Scope: all 39 HTML pages, including the homepage, service and industry profiles, dedicated project and case-study stories, blog articles, forms, and legal pages.

## Final verification

- 195 responsive page loads at 1440, 1024, 768, 390, and 320 pixels.
- Full-page desktop screenshots and visual review across the site.
- Automated WCAG A/AA checks with axe-core across all 39 pages; final findings rechecked to zero.
- 64 interaction assertions covering navigation, tabs, sliders, filters, FAQs, and forms.
- Static local asset, internal page, anchor, duplicate-ID, heading, and inline-style audits.
- Exact project/case card-to-destination mapping checks.
- Legacy `service-single.html` redirect verified to `web-development.html`.

## Passing

- No horizontal page overflow at any tested width.
- No failed HTTP assets, browser JavaScript errors, duplicate IDs, missing page H1s, unnamed images, empty buttons, or empty links.
- Global header, footer, desktop mega-menu, About drawer, sticky header, and mobile navigation work correctly.
- All six homepage service tabs and mobile service links work.
- Testimonial controls, all 18 FAQ implementations, and project/case/blog filters work.
- Contact and Start Project required fields validate correctly.
- Footer CTA and header content remain visible during fast scrolling and full-page rendering.
- Project, case-study, industry, service, and blog archive cards have genuine matching destinations.
- No tested WCAG A/AA violations remain.

## Gaps closed in the final pass

1. Rebuilt `case-studies.html` as an editorial case archive with a featured automation story, challenge/response summaries, filters, and measurement principles.
2. Rebuilt `case-study-single.html` with dedicated automation artwork, operational context, human-reviewed strategy, experience direction, and proposed validation measures.
3. Added dedicated project stories:
   - `commerce-project.html`
   - `identity-project.html`
   - `property-project.html`
   - `wellness-project.html`
4. Updated every Projects and Case Studies card to its matching dedicated story.
5. Rebuilt `pricing.html` with custom engagement columns, a readable comparison table, and an editorial always-included section while preserving custom quotes.
6. Rebuilt `testimonials.html` with a featured editorial quote, open quote rails, partnership principles, and team context while preserving demo-content labelling.
7. Converted legacy `service-single.html` into a canonical redirect to `web-development.html`.
8. Removed header/footer opacity animation states that could temporarily hide important content.
9. Corrected all identified text-contrast issues and increased form-helper readability.

## External production dependencies

These are not UI defects and cannot be completed honestly without external inputs:

- **Form delivery:** Contact and Start Project currently prepare populated `mailto:` messages. Production lead capture requires a verified server/CRM endpoint, spam protection, monitoring, and deployment configuration.
- **Client proof:** Projects remain labelled concepts and testimonials remain labelled demo content. Verified client quotes, attribution, and real outcomes must be supplied and approved before replacing those labels.

The static site has no known remaining responsive-layout or tested accessibility defects from the automated QA report. The deeper content and navigation inventory in `UI-GAPS.md` is now marked implemented: homepage mappings, Explore navigation, service/industry artefacts, project deliverables and timelines, Blog search and article navigation, form review steps, and visual variations have all been completed and retested.
